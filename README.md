ImageWebP
======================

WebP is a modern image format that provides superior lossless and lossy
compression for images on the web. WebP create smaller, richer images that make
the web faster.

Provided a configurable feature to enable WebP conversion for any image.
As all browsers are currently not supporting Webp format image, care has been
taken so that the browsers that do not support it will render the original image
uploaded as (JPEG/PNG/GIF).
